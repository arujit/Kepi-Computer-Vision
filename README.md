# Computer-Vision

There are Two directories in this project.

#### Cascades - Contains Trained Haar and LBP Cascades used for the project.
#### Scripts - Contains the experimented tracker scripts and test script for performance of the Cascades.

### Basic Idea - 
- Creating a proper database of Positive and Negative images for Detection object Training purpose.
- Training LBP and Haar Cascades for detection of vehicles.
- Efficient Object detection and visualizing performances
- Developing an efficient tracking methodlogy for tracking of detected object
- Path and lane detection (Later Stages)
