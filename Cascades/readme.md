# CASCADES

## Haar like Cascades -
Haar-like features are digital image features used in object detection. They owe their name to their intuitive similarity with Haar wavelets and were used in the first real-time object detector.
They use sliding windows to get features and train upon them.Haar Cascades are comparetively slower with respect to LBP features and take a lot of time to train.But they are way more accurate than LBP features as they use floating numbers for all the calculations part.

## LBP Cascades - 
Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number. Due to its discriminative power and computational simplicity, LBP texture operator has become a popular approach in various applications.
